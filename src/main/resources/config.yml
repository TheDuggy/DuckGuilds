#The inviteDeleteTime is the length of time since a guild-invite was created until it is deleted.
#IMPORTANT! This is in ticks(1 sec = 20 ticks)
#By default it is set to 15 min(18000 ticks)
inviteDeleteTime: 18000

#This option sets hoe many guilds can be created! By default, it is set to false. It must between 1 and
#9223372036854775807. If it is 0 or bigger than 9223372036854775807,it will take the default value
#(false), which is endless! If you enter something that isn't a false or not a valid number, the plugin
#would ignore it!
maxGuilds: false

#-----------Logging----------#
##############################

#This defines where the log files of the plugin are stored. Default means in <DATA_FOLDER>/logs/
logging-path: default

#log-level can be either IMPORTANT or DEBUG, where IMPORTANT is the default. IMPORTANT will only show errors
#in the servers console. DEBUG logs EVERY thing that happens in the plugins. Thi can be useful when for example
#the storage is broken. For the log-files, DEBUG is always enabled.
log-level: IMPORTANT

#This option defines the max-file-size of the log-files in BYTES. Keep in mind that the log-files are also compressed into
#a .tar.gz archive. Default is 10000000
max-log-file-size: 10000000


##############################
#-----------Storage----------#
##############################

#This option sets which type of storage should be used! On small server, File (which is the default)
#is strong enough, but if you've got a server with >100 players it's highly recommended using a
#database (MySQL)!
storageType: File

#If this is set to true, the plugin will automatically start in the file-system-mode if db-connection is not
#available. By default, it is set to false, which means that the plugin will show a small warning-msg in the
#consol and then disable itself!
useFileSystemOnInvalidConnection: false

#This is the folder where all guild-data is stored! By default, it's the root-folder of the server.
#If the path doesn't exist than it automatically uses the root-folder of the server.
#If you change this, and you already created a few guilds, they would be lost!
#The old guild-folder isn't deleted automatically, so you can copy all guild-files to the new folder!
guildDirRootPath: default

#If this option is set to true, the plugin will automatically delete all old files/record while
#migratiing to a new storage-type!
deleteOldStorageSectionsWhileMigration: true
